 <div id="explain">
I have been biking in and around Cambridge for a decade.  I live here.  My kids go to school here.
<br>
I care deeply about bike safety. I pursued this challenge because I have come far too close to 
<br>
becoming a statistic in this data set.  
<br><br>
I think we have an opportunity to use this data to inform a public policy response. 
<br><br> 
I think an approach where creative signs are posted (at least temporarily) 
<br> 
around Cambridge could be effective in addressing this issue.
<br><br> 
The question is:  where to post signs?  
<br><br> 
My approach was to take the address/intersection location data, and use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>, 
<br> 
combined with QGis, to visualize the problem.  I installed the former on my AWS free tier, 
<br> 
and grabbed <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html">TIGER</a> shapefiles for MA, and the <a href="http://www.cambridgema.gov/GIS/gisdatadictionary/Trans/TRANS_Centerlines.aspx">GIS data sets from the City of Cambridge</a>.
<br> 
The PostGIS geocoding functions allowed me to visualize where accidents were happening.
<br> 
I then used a kmeans clustering function to define 50 clusters across Cambridge.
<br><br> 
Next, I looked at street centerlines 'near' the defined clusters, trying to find
<br> 
important intersections. I used PostGIS buffer / overlap / intersection data 
<br> 
to identify these:<br>
<img src="img/qgis_pic.png" width="700px">
<br><br>
Lastly, I wanted a simple way to show the final product. <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a> was selected 
<br>for this purpose, cutting out a direct db call in favor of exported GeoJSON 
<br>/ lat lon data from Postgres.
<br><br> 
Conclusion:  I believe most of the 40 proposed locations for signage, as determined 
<br> 
by this repeatable (and tunable) approach - would work well.  10 small clusters 
<br> 
(those with under 30 accidents) were removed from consideration.  And high traffic 
<br>
streets are would obviously be valuable to cross-reference with this output.
<br><br>
Because this approach combines open data and statistics, this exercise is not only repeatable 
<br>
in other communities, but also it can be refined over time.
<br><br> 
I belive the message on these signs should be a mix of memorable, unique and cheeky.
<br> 
The signs I created and posted in the U/I should reflect this.  They would give me pause,
<br> 
and raise my awareness, whether I was biking or driving in Cambridge.
<br><br> 
Thank you for bringing attention to this issue.
